                Hello and welcome to your new job as Head of Dragon Resources Management of the ancient kingdom of Mugloar!
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p>
                Every day knights take on brave, and frankly quite self-destructive, journeys to conquer our kingdom.
                This might be because of the rumours of indescribably gorgeous princesses we started when we were bored.
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p>
                Anyway, the relentless princess-snatching, dragon-slaying, tincan-dressed nuisances need to be stopped.
                The stopping needs to be done effectively, which means we are going to have to use dragons.
                Studies by our kingdomâ€™s top scientists show that dragons are the most efficient method to get rid of knights
                (and everything else except Drakie-Darling dragon treats with spinach).
            </p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p>
                With great efficiency comes great cost however, dragons are not cheap pets,
                especially given their intense dislike towards roasted spinach dragon treats, which your predecessor on the job already ordered a 3 year supply of.
                The dragons enjoyed him a lot more than the treats mentioned before.
                To make up for the mistake of proposing vegetarian habits to dragons and to keep our pet keeping costs in check,
                your task is to have a consistent dragon survival rate of at least 50%.
